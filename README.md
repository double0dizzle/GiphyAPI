# GiphyAPI

This is my first Gif app, which hopefully gives its users a sense of beauty for various mountain ranges around the world.  

The user may also enter any other mountain range they can think of and add a button, which will then produce 10 related gifs if clicked.

Keep in mind that though that the gif filter will not restrict the users input to just mountain ranges.

Please enjoy, and thank you for visiting my page.
